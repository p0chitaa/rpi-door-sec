## conn.sh
This is a script to connect to the database and select the correct database

## main.py
this is the new version of combined.py. The data is added to the sql table but something is wrong. Im 
conflicted because while i want to store images in the sql table we then have to convert a lot of stuff
when we use the search function. We'll have to speak about that.

## reset.py
Coding in nano is terrible, so i use visual studio and every time i need to update the program i run
reset.py, which deletes main.py, and creates a new main.py where i re-copy all the code from  visual studio.
***WARNING*** this does delete main.py so be careful using this if youre in the middle of programming 
if you dont have the code somewhere else.
